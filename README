Answers to README questions:

I actually defined an UX flow to let users edit a description on an existing TODO item.

The implemetation of the Edit function is :
Create a noticable button with the text "Edit" on it.
When pressing the button, the text of the description changes the style to bold and becomes enabled 
so that the user can edit the text.
The button now shows "done", when pressing the button the text view becomes disabled and the new description is saved.

when I considered how to do it, I though about the following:
It is very easy for users to find the edit button and understand how it works.
The changes in the UI (changing the style of the text for example) are noticable and help the user understand the flow.
The implementation was not hard at all and was similar to implementing the delete function.
The edit function is very similar to edit flows in Android world.
